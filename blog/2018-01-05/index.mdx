[Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) is a fully managed NoSQL database that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. Similar to other databases, DynamoDB stores data in tables. Each table contains multiple items, and each item is composed of one or more attributes. We are going to cover some basics in the following chapters. But to get a better feel for it, here is a great guide on [DynamoDB](https://www.dynamodbguide.com/).

### Create Table

First, log in to your [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com/) and select **DynamoDB** from the list of services.

Next, Select **Create table**.

Enter the **Table name** and **Primary key** info as shown below. Just make sure that **todoId** is in camel case.
Make sure **Use default settings** is checked.

Note that the default setting provisions 5 reads and 5 writes. When you create a table, you specify how much provisioned throughput capacity you want to reserve for reads and writes. DynamoDB will reserve the necessary resources to meet your throughput needs while ensuring consistent, low-latency performance. One read capacity unit can read up to 8 KB per second and one write capacity unit can write up to 1 KB per second. You can change your provisioned throughput settings, increasing or decreasing capacity as needed.

After everything is entered properly select **create**.

Each DynamoDB table has a primary key, which cannot be changed once set. The primary key uniquely identifies each item in the table, so that no two items can have the same key. DynamoDB supports two different kinds of primary keys:

- Partition key
- Partition key and sort key

To further your understanding of how indexes work in DynamoDB, you can read more here: [DynamoDB Core Components](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.CoreComponents.html).

The **todos** table has now been created. If you find yourself stuck with the **Table is being created message**; refresh the page manually.
